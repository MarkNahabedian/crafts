# PanaVise Jaws

This page describes the V-jaws I made for my PanaVise.

I wanted to be able to hold cylindrical stock in my PanaVise (I think
what I have is a
[model 301](https://www.panavise.com/index.html?pageID=1&page=full&--eqskudatarq=2).

With these jaws I have held coiles of copper wire for cutting jump
rings using a jewlers saw.  These rings were used to make a chain mail
neck tie.

I developed the CAD model for these in OnShape.  The model can be found
[here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/5ea02c7708d3e42bf5c7c22b/w/1590be5a74c3a8daa0f2e085/e/34f4a2c4e6a21a816c63b69f).
