    <h1>Continuous Weave Möbius Loop</h1>

    <p>
      This is a continuously woven möbius loop.  It does not have ends
      that were joined together after the weaving was complete.  The
      warp threads were continuously looped over the loom with a half
      twist introduced while warping.

    <h2>Loom</h2>

    <p>
      The loom is basically just a structure for holding the warp
      threads in tension and stationary as you weave.  It doesn't
      matter what you make it out of or how you make it.  I happened
      to have a bunch of scrap 1010 series (1 inch cross section)
      T-slot aluminum extrusion, so I used that.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      My loom was basically a framework holding a triangular
      arrangement of bars that the warp would pass around.
    </p>

    <h2>Combs</h2>

    <p>
      I needed a way to keep the warp threads ordered as I warped the
      loom.
    </p>

    <p>
      I made a pair of combs out of popsicle sticks, stacked,
      staggered and glued together.  Once the glue dried, the assembly
      was sawed in half on the axis perpendicular to the popsicle
      sticks.  Holes were then drilled so that the combs could be
      mounted to two of the loom struts.
    </p>

    <p>
      Many of these glue joints failed though and needed to be
      reglued.  I expect the popsicle sticks might have a finish on
      them which I should have sanded off before gluing.
      </p>

    <h2>Warping</h2>

    <p>
      These combs are used to keep the warp threads organized while
      warping.  They are removed once weaving commences since then the
      weave itself will keep the threads ordered.
    </p>

    <p>
      I warped the loom starting with the middle warp thread and then
      working my way outwards, alternating sides.  I tied off the end
      of the first warp thread to the round tensioning arm, looped it
      over the top bar, through the middle slots of the top and bottom
      combs and then back around the tensioning arm to the left of
      where it started.  From here it loops over the top bar, through
      the slot in the top comb just to the left of the middle warp
      thread, across the outside of the middle warp thread, through
      the slot on the bottom comb just to the right of the middle
      thread and then around the tensioning arm to the right of the
      middle warp thread.  Note that between the tensioning arm and
      the other two bars the warp threads should always run parallel
      to one another.  The only place they cross is between the two
      combs. When a warp thread crosses from left to right it goes
      around the outside.  When it crosses from right to left it goes
      across the inside.  This is how the half twist of the möbius
      loop in introduced.
    </p>

    <p>
      To change colors I just tied a strand of the new color to the
      old near the tensioning arm using a square knot.
    </p>

    <p>
      I used a bit of sewing thread to tie the free remaining warp
      thread off to the last warp thread temporarily to maintain
      tension on the warp.  I could then use the remainder of what I
      had been using for warp as weft without more cutting and tieing.

        This picture shows the use of "combs" (made from glued together
        popsicle sticks) to keep the warp threads organized.  The loom
        was warped starting with the middle warp thread and working
        outwards to the edge, alternating sides to add the half twist.

    <h2>Harnesses</h2>

    <p>
      The loom employs two harnesses that are moved in opposition to
      each other.  I tried using only one harness but my sheds were
      not reliable. I was weaving with woolen yarn that was too clingy
      to pass by easily.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each harness has two sides, each made of a pair of tongue
      depressors glued surface to surface for added strength and
      thickness.  Between the two sides run two pieces of 6-32
      threaded rod sheathed in 3/16 metal tubing (brass or aluminum
      are fine).  At one end of the threaded rod is a nylon lock nut
      and washer.  Each rod then passes through one side piece, the
      metal tubing, the other side piece and then a knurled brass nut.
      I splurged on round knurled brass nuts instead of wing nuts so
      that my threads were less likely to get hooked on them.
    </p>

    <p>
      An extra pair of holes were drilled in each side piece a short
      way from the center.  The nearer rod assembly can be run through
      these holes to serve as a jig for tieing heddles.
    </p>

    <h2>Heddling</h2>

    <p>
      The first heddles I made worked well enough but we're harder to
      install than the second.  Each heddle consisted of a pair of
      loops. Each loop was tied on the heddle jig described above.  I
      think using a surgeon's knot rather than a square knot makes
      loops of more consistent size.  Over the course of weaving I had
      trouble with the knots coming untied due to the repeated tension
      and slack on each loop.  For this reason I put a drop of CA glue
      on each knot.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each of these heddles consists of a top loop and a bottom loop.
      Each loop loops through the other to form a square knot around a
      warp thread.  The top rod of the harness is then run through the
      top loop of the heddle and the bottom rod through the bottom
      loop.  Heddles were installed from left to right on the odd
      numbered warp threads (in the order that they pass through the
      top comb).
    </p>

    </figure>

    <p>
      The easier heddling approach uses two long cords: one for each
      rod of the harness.  I used "squidding line" from my maternal
      grand mother's treasure trove of interesting and some day useful
      things.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each cord loops around a warp cord and then back around it's
      rod.  The two cords are threaded to cross each other with the
      warp cord in between them.  I used binder clips to hold each
      cord to its respective rod while my hands were busy with the
      other.  This is how I heddled all of the even numbered warp
      cords to the second harness.  The cords are then tied off to
      their respective rods, making sure all of the loops are even and
      a little bit loose so the warp cords can be slid through as the
      weaving progresses.
    </p>

        I added a second harness to work in opposition to the first
        because my sheds weren't opening reliably.

    <h2>Shuttle</h2>

    <p>
      I made a shuttle out of a piece of scrap wood.  Unfortunately, I
      got a bit careless with the coping saw and cut off two of it's
      ears.
    </p>


    <h2>Weaving</h2>

    <p>
      I first wove in two tongue depressors to verify my two sheds and
      provide a straight line to beat against.  Actually, the tieing
      off of the warp thread when it transitioned to the weft was done
      after the two temporary tongue depressor rows were woven.
    </p>

        test shots.  This is before I added the second harness.
      </figurecaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      I then wove in the weft, alternating sheds.  After a few inches
      the tongue depressors could be removed.  I forget what I did to
      the starting end of the warp that was originally tied to the
      tensioning arm.  I think I just tied it to one of it's neighbors
      and cut it off, but I might have sewn it in with a darning
      needle.
    </p>

    <p>
      I continued weaving until the unwoven section was too small to
      open a big enough shed to fit the shuttle through.  At that
      point I switched to a crochet hook.  Eventually there was not
      enough unwoven warp to fit both harnesses so I removed one,
      keeping the other to track which warps were which, and wove the
      rest with a darning needle.  Once space was too tight for that I
      unthreaded the darning needle and used it as a stick to spread
      the recent weft threads into whatever gap remained.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is probably no utility to having a woven möbius loop, but
      making one was an interesting and gratifying mental and
      dexterity exercise.
