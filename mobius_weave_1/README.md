# continuous Weave Möbius Loop

This directory documents my first continuous weave möbius loop.

The loop does not have ends that were joined together after the
weaving was complete.  The warp threads were continuously looped over
the loom with a half twist introduced while warping.

For details, see [here]{https://marknahabedian.github.io/crafts/mobius_weave_1/moebius_weaving.html).


## Other People's Möbius Loop Weavind Projects

Here are some Möbius loop weaving projects from others that I found
through a Google search:

* Jeremy Sarchet constructed a special purpose loop out of wire for [his Möbius weave](https://www.jeremysarchet.com/blog/seamless-mobius-weave/).

* Kim Winter also used a wire frame for [her loop](https://flextiles.wordpress.com/2020/07/14/coiled-mobius-strips/).
