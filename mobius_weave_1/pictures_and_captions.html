      This picture shows the use of "combs" (made from glued together
      popsicle sticks) to keep the warp threads organized.  The loom
      was warped starting with the middle warp thread and working
      outwards to the edge, alternating sides to add the half twist.

      I added a second harness to work in opposition to the first
      because my sheds weren't opening reliably.

    <figurecaption>
      <br>
      I was having trouble opening good sheds with only a single
      harness, so I added a second one.

      I adopted a much simpler heddle mechanism for the second
      harness.  The second harness is the one further from the weave.
