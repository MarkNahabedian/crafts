    <h1>Tensegrity Construction Toy</h1>

    <p>
      I have a toy tensegrity construction kit with struts that are
      maybe six inches long, but I wanted something on a larger scale
      -- maybe with two foot struts.  I decided to use plastic tubing --
      -- and bungee cord.
    </p>


    <h2>PEX Tubing Struts</h2>
    
    <p>
      I chose to use 1/2 inch PEX tubing because it is readily
      available, inexpensive, and easy to cut.
    </p>

    <p>
      What I didn't realize at the time is how much work it is to
      straighten.  Even the straight lengths from Home Depot aren't
      straight.  Nothing at Home Depot is straight.  One can find
      straight two foot lengths in a longer piece though.
    </p>

    <p>
      I originally started with a 50 foot coil of PEX and tried to
      straighten it.
    </p>

    <h3>Straightening in an Oven</h3>

    <p>
      I first tried straightening two foot lengths of tubing in an
      electric oven by heating them to 280F for 10 minutes.  I think
      this woulld have worked better if I had a better way at the time
      to hold the tubing straight as it cooled.  My own oven was
      broken at the time though so I was using the oven at a friend's
      house.
    </p>

    <h3>Special straightening Oven</h3>
    
    <p>
      I used 4 feet of aluminum dryer duct and a hot air gun to make
      an oven.  The ducting was wrapped in towels to provide some
      insulation.  A length of tubing was tied in various places along
      its length to a piece of angle iron using cotton sash cord, and
      placed inside the duct.  Hot air was blown into the duct until
      the temperature of the tubing reached nearly 300F at the other
      end (I think I used a meat thermometer if I recall correctly).
      This worked except that I could only straighten one or two pieces
      at a time and the sash cord left indentations in the tubing.
      Also the ends still had some bend in them, presumably because
      there was not sufficient leverage to hold them straight.
    </p>

    <p>
      I eventually got 30 2 foot lengths of 1/2 inch PEX tubing that
      were straight enough.  I then used a router table with a brand
      new 1/4 inch bit and purpose built sled to cut a slot 3/4 inch
      deep at each end of each strut.
    <p>

    <p>
      30 struts is enough to make each of the Platonic solids.
    </p>


    <h2>Bungee Cord Loops</h2>

    <p>
      I purchased the bungee cord, the crimping tool and the connectors
      from
      <a href="https://www.htbbungeecords.com/">
        HTB Bungee Cords
      </a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      To ensure that all of my loops were the same size, I built a jig
      out of K'nex that coould be used to measure a loop and hold it
      under constant tension as I crimped the ends together.
    </p>

    <p>
      The jig has four coplaner pulleys on top around which the bungee
      cord can be looped to form a horizontal rounded corner rectangle with a known
      perimeter.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are two additional vertically oriented pulleys in the top
      front of the jig.  Between those tow pulleys is where the bungee
      cord gets crimped into a loop.
    </p>

         alt="Photo of the jig that was used to ensure all bungee cord
         loops are the same size.">
    
    <p>
      In the photo above, the bungee cord comes off the spool (not
      shown) to the bottom left of view, passes around the right
      vertical pulley, then the left, then around the four horizontal
      pulleys and back across the crimping area where the free end is
      clipped to the frame of the jig.
    </p>

    <p>
      The plastic bottle on the right hand side of the jig contains
      nails to serve as a weight (the total weight of bottle, clip,
      and contents was 17.4 ounces).  It is clipped to the bungee cord
      just before it passes around the right vertical pulley to ensure
      constant controlled tension on the bungee cord while it is
      crimped.
    </p>


    <h2>Constructing Tensegrity Models</h2>

    <p>
      Now that I had 30 struts, each with its own bungee loop
      stretched end to end, it was time to start building.
    </p>

    <p>
      I first made a tetrahedron, the simplest of the Platonic solids.
      The slot at the end of each strut is deep enough to hold the
      buingee cord from another strut as well as its own.  Each vertex
      of the tetrahedron has the ends of three struts coming together,
      each catching the bungee loop of the strut clockwise to it in
      its slot.  Clockwise or counterclockwise doesn't matter as long
      as every vertex has the same chirality.
    </p>

    <p>
      The other Platonic solids were trickier though because the
      bungee cord doesn't stay in the slots until the entire structure
      is under tension.

1/8 diameter hole to accomodate a reusable cotter pin.
