I went to the Cambridge Public Library's Hive maker space to try
drawing these pacges on the Brother Cricut.

I used Safari to open the stitch HTML files from Github Pages.  Chrome
does not render the right margin SVG correctly.

From Safari I used the print dialog to write a PDF file.

The Cricut Design Space application does not open PDF files.  A staff
member used Adobe Illustrator to generate a PNG file from the PDF.  In
that process he needed to reintroduce the margins because the PDF was
cropped to the bounding rectangle of the ink.  If I continue to use
HTML files and this workflow then I should add a dotted or dashed
border to the outermost HTML content element.

TAKEAWAY:  Add visible border to HTML page.

We did a test print onto a heavy weight sheet of paper.  It took quite
a while to print.  The body text of the resulting page was hard to
read because when the Cricut uses the pen to draw it follows the
outline of the image, effectively turning the letters into an outline
font.  This made the body text characters a bit wider and they
blurred into each other.

TAKEAWAY:  Use a thinner pen.

TAKEAWAY:  Try using straight SVG with a vector font instead of HTML.

Received an answer to my email inquiry of the Cambridge Public
Library's hive.  When downloading Cricut Design Space they say it
doesn't matter which Cricut I tell them I'm using.

The machines at The Hive are "Cricut Maker" and "Cricut Maker 3".

It can be downloaded from https://design.cricut.com/.

Installed Cricut Design Space on my MacBook.  Maybe I could use
Cricut's software to design my pages.

I could try to render the text directly in SVG or try to script
Inkscape.

Inkscape has a Hershey text extension.

These elements are part of the SVG 1.2 standard.  Thought not
supported by any browsers, they are implemented in Inkscape:

<flowRoot>
<flowRegion>
<flowPara>

<flowRoot
   xml:space="preserve"
   id="flowRootExample"
   style="font-size:14px;font-family:sans-serif;fill:#000000;">
  <flowRegion
     id="flowRegionBoundary">
    <rect
       id="rectBoundary"
       width="200"
       height="100"
       x="50"
       y="50" />
  </flowRegion>
  <flowPara
     id="flowParaContent">This is a long string of text that will automatically wrap when it reaches the 200px width limit of the rectangular boundary defined in the flowRegion.</flowPara>
</flowRoot>


A document can be exported from Inkscape in Plain SVG Format to
provide input for Cricut Design Space.

Applying Inkscape's Hershey Text Extension will layout the text and
produce an SVG path element for each glyph.

To convert the HTML files I have to SVG, Google Gemenii suggested that
I use AIVector.ai (https://aivector.ai/html-to-svg-converter) or SVG
AI (https://www.svgai.org/convert/html-to-svg) to convert to an SVG
file and then use Inkscape to turn the SVG text into paths.

AIVector.ai produces output with smaller, denser text than in the
original HTML.

SVG AI leaves too much space before the period at the end of a sen
tence.

Both just convert to an SVG file containing a single image element with
a "data://" href.

Aftter being told these results, Gemenii suggested opening the HTML in
a browser and "Print > Save as PDF".  Import the resulting PDF file
into Inkscape.  Select each block of text and do "Path > Object to
path" (Shift+Ctrl+C).  Maybe then to "Path > Simplify" (Ctrl-L).
