I went to the Cambridge Public Library's Hive maker space to try
drawing these pacges on the Brother Cricut.

I used Safari to open the stitch HTML files from Github Pages.  Chrome
does not render the right margin SVG correctly.

From Safari I used the print dialog to write a PDF file.

The Cricut Design Space application does not open PDF files.  A staff
member used Adobe Illustrator to generate a PNG file from the PDF.  In
that process he needed to reintroduce the margins because the PDF was
cropped to the bounding rectangle of the ink.  If I continue to use
HTML files and this workflow then I should add a dotted or dashed
border to the outermost HTML content element.

TAKEAWAY:  Add visible border to HTML page.

We did a test print onto a heavy weight sheet of paper.  It took quite
a while to print.  The body text of the resulting page was hard to
read because when the Cricut uses the pen to draw it follows the
outline of the image, effectively turning the letters into an outline
font.  This made the body text characters a bit wider and they
blurred into each other.

TAKEAWAY:  Use a thinner pen.

TAKEAWAY:  Try using straight SVG with a vector font instead of HTML.

Received an answer to my email inquiry of the Cambridge Public
Library's hive.  When downloading Cricut Design Space they say it
doesn't matter which Cricut I tell them I'm using.

The machines at The Hive are "Cricut Maker" and "Cricut Maker 3".

It can be downloaded from https://design.cricut.com/.

Installed Cricut Design Space on my MacBook.  Maybe I could use
Cricut's software to design my pages.

I could try to render the text directly in SVG or try to script
Inkscape.

Inkscape has a Hershey text extension.

These elements are part of the SVG 1.2 standard.  Thought not
supported by any browsers, they are implemented in Inkscape:

<flowRoot>
<flowRegion>
<flowPara>

<flowRoot
   xml:space="preserve"
   id="flowRootExample"
   style="font-size:14px;font-family:sans-serif;fill:#000000;">
  <flowRegion
     id="flowRegionBoundary">
    <rect
       id="rectBoundary"
       width="200"
       height="100"
       x="50"
       y="50" />
  </flowRegion>
  <flowPara
     id="flowParaContent">This is a long string of text that will automatically wrap when it reaches the 200px width limit of the rectangular boundary defined in the flowRegion.</flowPara>
</flowRoot>


A document can be exported from Inkscape in Plain SVG Format to
provide input for Cricut Design Space.

Applying Inkscape's Hershey Text Extension will layout the text and
produce an SVG path element for each glyph.

To convert the HTML files I have to SVG, Google Gemenii suggested that
I use AIVector.ai (https://aivector.ai/html-to-svg-converter) or SVG
AI (https://www.svgai.org/convert/html-to-svg) to convert to an SVG
file and then use Inkscape to turn the SVG text into paths.

AIVector.ai produces output with smaller, denser text than in the
original HTML.

SVG AI leaves too much space before the period at the end of a sen
tence.

Both just convert to an SVG file containing a single image element with
a "data://" href.

Aftter being told these results, Gemenii suggested opening the HTML in
a browser and "Print > Save as PDF".  Import the resulting PDF file
into Inkscape.  Select each block of text and do "Path > Object to
path" (Shift+Ctrl+C).  Maybe then to "Path > Simplify" (Ctrl-L).

Installed Inkscape on my MacBook.

The Hershey Text extension is already available under menu bar >
Extensions > Text > Hershey.

Opened two of my HTML files (101... and 504...) in Firefox (Chrome
looses the hole markings on the right margin) and dif Print > Save to
PDF.  Pages: Current.  Save.  The file gets saved to ~/Documents.

Start Inkscape.  Select PDF file to open.  The Firefox "Print to PDF"
saves these to ~/Documents.

When importing a PDF to inkscape, these are the various options for
the "clip" pulldown:

 * Media Box: Crops to the physical size of the page.
 * Crop Box: Crops to the intended display/print region.
 * Trim Box: Crops to the final trimmed size.
 * Art Box: Crops to the extent of the artwork.
 * Bleed Box: Crops to the region including printer bleed marks. 

Use Media Box.

Opened a PDF in Inkscape and it looks ludicrously small on the canvas.

From the top menu bar do View > Zoom > Document.  This gives us
something we can see and looks right.

Convert to single stroke fonts: menu bar > Extensions > Text > Hershey
Text.  Fong face: Hershey Sans 1 stroke.  Don't select "preserve
original text.  Cluse the Hershey dialog.  Menu bar > File > Save as.

EXAMINING THE RESULTS:

The punch holes are too close to the text.

The title text is more than one line.  This might be because the HTML
page width isn't being set.


2026_02-11

Added width and height CSS values to STYLESHEET for html and body
elements.

Added script_generate_stitch_pages.jl which can be run as

    julia script_generate_stitch_pages.jl

to generate all of the stitch pages.

Why is it writiing each file twice?


PAGE CONVERSION PROCEDURE:

Do this for each stitch file:

1) Open a page in Firefox.
Print...
Save to PDF
Pages: current
under More Settings choose
Scale 100; margings none
and turn off "Print headers and footers>.
Save.

2) Open the resulting PDF file in Inkscape.
Internal Import tab:
Clip to: Media Box
Fonts: draw all text
Turn off Embed Images and Import Pages.
Ok.

3) Convert to single stroke fonts:
menu bar > Extensions > Text > Hershey Text
Font face: Hershey Sans 1 stroke.
Don't select "preserve original text.
Apply.
Close the Hershey dialog.

4) Menu bar > File > Save as.

END OF PAGE CONVERSION PROCEDURE.

AFter fixing the page size and refining the conversion procedure the
pages look better.  It might be time to make trip to the Cricut again.

Probably need to buy a fine tipped Sharpie and get the appropriate 3d
model for the corresponding pen holder.

I asked Google Gemenii if it was possible to automate the procedure.
It suggested this command line:

  inkscape input.pdf --batch-process --actions="select-all;org.ekips.filter.hershey.set_text;export-filename:output.svg;export-do"

Gemenii also suggests adding "export-plain-svg" to that command line.

For now this seems like there are too many pieces to get together.


Trying to open up the text a bit, I added these stylesheet settings
for the descriptive text:

    font-size: 0.25in;
    line-height: 1.5;

but this causes the description for stitch 504 to overrun a page.

The stitch 503 description fits on one page with these settings.

Using

    font-size: 0.2in;

causes stitch 504 to fit on one page.


Google Gemenii suggested this page for advice about generating files
for Cricut:

https://www.reddit.com/r/Inkscape/comments/11m1otz/how_to_make_inkscape_work_with_cricut/#:~:text=You%20don't%20need%20to,objects%20to%20paths%20%2D%20text%20included.

It says:

You don't need to save the Inkscape file as plain svg. Inkscape's svg
output works fine and is what I use with my Cricut. Nor do you need to
specifically select inches - I use cm or mm for both canvas and object
dimensions.

What you DO need to do in order for the Cricut to correctly read the
Inkscape svg file information is convert all objects to paths - text
included. Once converted to paths you need to place similar coloured
paths into their own dedicated and seperate layers. For example, I
name a layer BLACK and I put the relevant path in that layer. I also
name the path BLACK. Ditto for red. Create a layer named RED, and put
the path you want cut red in that layer. Nse the path RED. And so
on... DO NOT CREATE GROUPS! You want layers of paths.

Once the image is complete and you are ready to start cutting make a
backup (if you haven't already...)

You can save the file as a normal Inkscape svg and drag and drop the
file into the DesignSpace dialog that asks you to select your local
file. Obviously you can just navigate to the file on your computer and
select it that way too.

You will find the svg is of the correct dimensions, colours, and
layers.
