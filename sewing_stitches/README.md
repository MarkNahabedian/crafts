# Examples of Sewing Stitches

I'm hoping to produce a "book" that illustrates how common sewing
stitches, particularly machine stitches, are formed.

There will be one leaf for each stitch.  Each leaf will be made of
fabric and have descriptive text printed on it.  The leaf will have a
row of holes punched about a half inch from the edge.  Paracord will
pass through these holes to illustrate each stitch.


## Links and references

Over the course of this project I've found some valuable web references.

The Groz-Beckert YouTube channel has slow motion animations for some
stitches:

- [301 lockstitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zk9h8ByMcvg)
- [401 one needle, one looper](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEr_SNFMIqw)
- [504 one needle, two loopers](ttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KMrsT6jPR7s)
- [605 3 needles, 5 threads](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH4mEIRzwOU)

ISO 4915_1991 provides descriptions of these and many other stitches,
but is unfortunately trapped behind a pay wall.

[This page](https://www.coats.com/en-us/info-hub/basic-stitch-types/)
also provides good descriptions and drawings for a number of stitches.
