    <h1>Trapezoidal Lap Joint</h1>
    
    <p>
    The trapezoidal lap joint is intended to be both temporary and
    rigid.  Constructions which use the joint can be assembled and
    disassembled over and over again without loosing rigidity.
    </p>

      I wanted to make a portable Moravian workbench but didn't want
      to use the tusked tennon joints that appear in most of the
      examples.  I was concerned about the combined thickness of the
      wedge, the walls of its mortise, and the walls of mortise of the
      ultimate joint being too think.
    </p>

    <p>
      The joint has two identical halves that each have an isosceles
      trapezoidal cut-out and a hole in the middle.

    <p>
      A wedge, cut at the same angle as the legs of the trapezoid, is
      glued to each cheek, just below the cut-out.  When the joint is
      assembled, each wedge will engage with the slanted walls of the
      trapezoidal cut-out of the other half of the other piece.

    <p>
      How do we ensure that all wedges and faces meet at the same time?
    </p>

    <p>
      Before the wedges are glued into place, the joint is screwed
      together with some fender washers in between the two "struts" to
      act as spacers. The legs are squared up to each other and the
      nut and bolt tightened, then the wedges are pressed and glued
      into place.  Glue is only applied to the rectilinear faces, not
      the angled faces.  Once the glue dries, the joint can be
      disassembled and the spacing washers removed.  Any extra
      overhanging meterial can be cut from the wedges.
    </p>

    <p>
      The spacing provided by the fender washers is important because
      if the joint bottoms out it can't be tightened further and will
      not be rigid.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've not provided measurements.  I made the prototype out of a
      2Ã—4.  That informs the length of the shorter base of each
      trapezoid.  I don't remember what angle I used for the leg cuts,
      but I expect it would depend on the thread picth of the bolt.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the joint is assembled and the wing nut hand tightened, it
      is very solid, very rigid.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've not yet built the workbench.
