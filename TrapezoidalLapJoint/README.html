    <h1>Trapezoidal Lap Joint</h1>
    
    <p>
    The trapezoidal lap joint is intended to be both temporary and
    rigid.  Constructions which use the joint can be assembled and
    disassembled over and over again without loosing rigidity.

    <h2>Motivation</h2>

    <p>
      I want to do hand tool woodworking but don't have much space.  I
      want a workbench that can be disassembled when not in use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sawing, planeing and chiseling apply a lot of horizontal force
      to the work piece and the workbench it is clamped to. That bench
      must be rigid to not rack and wobble under those forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      A common approach to building a portable workbench is to join
      legs to the horizontal stretchers that run between them using
      tusked mortise and tenon joints.  The Moravian workbench is an
      example of this.

    </ul>

    <p>
      A tusked mortize and tenon joint would require the legs to be
      very thick, and therefore heavy.  The leg has a mortise that the
      tennon on the end of the stretcher must fit through.  Through
      that tenon is another mortise to accomodate the wedge shaped key
      that holds the joint together.  The total thickness of the leg
      is determined by the thickness of four mortise walls and key.
      I'm concerned that to be strong this might also be bulky.
    </p>

    <h2>Alternatives</h2>

    <p>
      What are my alternatives to the tusked mortise and tenon?
    </p>

    <p>
      A cross lap joint is strong but is not temporary.  Each time the
      joint is fitted together and taken apart the wood wears and the
      joint gets looser.  What if the cross lap joint could be
      modified so that the joint got tighter as the two pieces being
      joinied were brought together?  This would happen if the walls
      of the notched cutouts were sloped and the mating surfaces had a
      matching slope.  I call this a trapezoidal lap joint because the
      notch in each half of the joint is an isoscles trapezoid rather
      than a rectangle.
    </p>

    <h2>Tricks for Making a Trapezoidal Lap Joint</h2>

    <p>
      Though the concept of the trapezoidal lap joint is obvious, it
      is not clear how to make one that works.  For there to be no
      play in the assembled joint, four angled faces must all come
      into contact with their mating faces at the same time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each half of the joint is a rectangular beam with an isoscles
      trapeoidal cut-out.  At the center of the face defined by the
      shorter base of the trapezoid (and the floor of the joint half)
      is a hole.  A bolt goes through those holes in the two halves of
      the joint.  That bolt and a mating wing nut are used to draw the
      two halves of the joint tightly together.
    </p>

         alt="four view drawing of one leg of the joint"/>
    
    <p>
      Wedges, cut at the same angle as the legs of the trapezoid, are
      glued to the sides of the beams to make a completed joint.  In
      the photo below, one wedge and the face it mates with are marked
      with circles.

         alt="Isometric drawing of the assembled joint"/>

    <p>
      How do we position the wedges so that all of the angled faces
      meet at once?  We fix the relative positions of the two halves
      of the joint first and then glue in the wedges.  The joint is
      assembled wit a stack of several (I used 3) fender washers in
      the middle to hold the two beams apart from each other.  The
      nut and bolt are tightened while making sure that the two beams
      form a right angle.  Then, for each wedge, glue is applied to
      the face that will meet the side of the beam and the wedge is
      inserted.  All four wedges are inserted with equal force.
    </p>

         alt="Exploded view of the joint"/>

    <p>
      The purpose of the stack of fender washers in the middle of the
      joint is to provide separation between the joint floors.  Onece
      the glue is dry, these washers are removed and no longer needed.
      No matter how much the wood wears, expands or contracts, this
      spacing will ensure that the joint never bottoms out and the
      onlt contact is on the angled surfaces.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've not provided measurements.  I made the prototype out of a
      2Ã—4.  That informs the length of the shorter base of each
      trapezoid.  I don't remember what angle I used for the leg cuts,
      but I expect it would depend on the thread picth of the bolt.
    </p>

    <p>
      When the joint is assembled and the wing nut hand tightened, it
      is very solid, very rigid.

      I've not yet built the workbench.
