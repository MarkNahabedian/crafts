# Trapezoidal Lap Joint

![photo of assembled joint](photos/cross.svg)

I wanted to make a portable Moravian workbench but didn't want to use
the wedged tennon joints that appear in most of the examples.  I was
concerned about the thickness of the wedge, it's mortise, and the
tennonmortise of the ultimate joint adding up to being too think.

This joint has sloped walls so that the joint itself tightens as a
bolt is tightened to bring the two halves together.

Note the wedges on the sides (marked with a black circle in the photo)
that will engage with the slanted walls of the joint.  The wedges are
cut at the same angle as the sides of the trapezoidal cutout.

Before the wedges are installed, the joint is screwed together with
some fender washers in between the two "struts" to act as spacers.
The legs are squared up to each other and the nut and bolt tightened,
then the wedges are pressed and glued into place.  Glue is only
applied to the rectilinear faces, not the angled faces.  Once the glue
dries, the joint can be disassembled and the spacing washers removed.

The spacing provided by the fender washers is important because if the
joint bottoms out it can't be tightened further and will be
under-constrained.

When the joint is assembled and the wing nut hand tightened, it is
very solid, very ridgid.

I've not yet built the workbench.


Here is my model of the joint in OnShape:
