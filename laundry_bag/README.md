# Laundry Basket Made From Old Bed Sheets


This is a laundry basket made from old bed sheets.  My design thoughts
and calculations are captured in a Jupyter Notebook.


## Viewing Directly from GitHub via nbviewer

You can view the notebook (read-only access) directly from GitHub
using
[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/MarkNahabedian/crafts/tree/main/laundry_bag/Making%20a%20Laundry%20Basket%20From%20Worn%20Out%20Bed%20Sheets.ipynb)


## Local Access and Editing

If you checkout the notebook file you can start a jupyter server and
edit it locally.


### Installing Jupyter Notebook

<pre>
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install jupyterlab
pip install --upgrade ipython jupyter
</pre>

I also installed jupyter themes so that I could read the notebook in a
dark theme, but this isn't required.

<pre>
pip install jupyterthemes
pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions
</pre>
