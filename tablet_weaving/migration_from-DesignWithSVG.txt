My original tablet weaving work was done in
https://github.com/MarkNahabedian/DesignWithSVG.  I decided it was
more appropriate to move it here.

I exported those changes (only concerning one file) from DesignWithSVG using

  git format-patch -o patchdir "168ca896d947ccf5d98c768bc484ec762f2ab97c"

I then used

  git am --committer-date-is-author-date <patch-file>

for each patch file to migrate the patches.

I'm commiting this file to describe and log the migration.
